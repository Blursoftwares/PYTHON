# **Python Basics**

## **Objectives**
- **Introduction to Variables**: Holding numbers, text, or other data.
- **Common Data Types**: Integers, floats, strings, booleans.

### **Introduction to Variables**

A variable is like a box where we can store different types of information. Itâ€™s like a name tag for a piece of data. You can store numbers, words, or other information inside a variable and use it later in your program.

---

#### **Example: Creating a variable**

```python
my_number = 5
my_text = "Hello!"
```
In this example:
- `my_number` is a variable that holds the number `5`.
- `my_text` is a variable that holds the word `"Hello!"`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Variables can change!
> Just like a box, you can put something new inside it. If you assign a new value to the variable, it will forget the old one and remember the new one.

```python
my_number = 10  # Now my_number holds the value 10 instead of 5

```
> [!NOTE]
>  Fun Fact
> Computers need to know the type of data so they know how to work with it. For example, you can add numbers but not mix numbers and words.

In the next module, we will learn how to work with these data types and use them in programs!
