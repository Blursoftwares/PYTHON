For this project, we will make a program that asks the user for their name and age, and then gives a special greeting.

1. Ask the user for their name.
2. Ask the user for their age.
3. Print out a greeting using their name and tell them how old they will be next year.

<!-- name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1, "years old!") -->
