# Project: Name Formatter
For this project, we will create a simple program that asks the user for their first and last names. The program will then print their full name in different formats.
1. Ask the user for their first name.
2. Ask the user for their last name.
3. Combine the names and print them normally.
4. Print the full name in all uppercase.
5. Print the full name in all lowercase.
6. Print the initials of the user (the first letter of their first and last name).

<!--first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

# Combine the names
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# Print the full name
print("Full name:", full_name)

# Print the full name in uppercase
print("Uppercase name:", full_name.upper())

# Print the full name in lowercase
print("Lowercase name:", full_name.lower())

# Print initials
initials = first_name[0] + last_name[0]
print("Your initials are:", initials.upper())
