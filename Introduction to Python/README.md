## What is Python?
Python is a simple, easy-to-learn programming language that helps us talk to computers. It’s like giving the computer a set of instructions to follow, and the computer does what we say. Many people use Python to create games, websites, and even robots!

> [!note] Python is like a recipe!
> Just like a recipe tells you what steps to follow to bake a cake, Python tells the computer what steps to follow to do a task.

## Why Do We Use Python?

**Easy to Read**: Python looks a lot like regular English, so it’s not hard to understand.
**Lots of Cool Stuff**: With Python, you can create fun things like games, apps, and even programs that can talk back to you!
**Popular**: Many people all over the world use Python, so you can easily find help when you’re stuck.

> [!important] Python is everywhere!
> You can use Python to make apps, websites, and even control robots.

## Running Python Code

You can write and run Python code in different places. Here are two easy ways:
* Replit: A website where you can write and test your Python code.
* Thonny: A program you can download on your computer to write Python code.

Let's get started. In your browser, create a file named `app.py`. Inside the folder, paste this snippet.
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
What happens?
When you run this code, the computer will show a message on the screen saying: `Hello, World!`
