# Number Guessing Game
For this project, we will create a simple number-guessing game. The computer will "think" of a number, and the user has to guess it.

Ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
Compare the guess with the correct number.
If the guess is correct, print a congratulations message.
If the guess is incorrect, give the user a hint (whether the number is too high or too low).

<!-- correct_number = 7
guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

if guess == correct_number:
    print("You guessed it right!")
elif guess > correct_number:
    print("Too high! Try again.")
else:
    print("Too low! Try again.") -->
