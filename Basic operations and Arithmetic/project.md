# Project: Make a Simple Calculator
For this project, we will build a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

1. Ask the user for two numbers.
2. Ask the user what kind of operation they want to do (add, subtract, multiply, or divide).
3. Show the result of the operation.

<!-- # Get input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Get the operation from the user
operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the operation
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

print("The result is:", result) -->
